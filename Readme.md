Reversible data hiding in encrypted domain (RDH-ED) has received tremendous attention from the research community because data can be embedded into cover media without exposing it to the third party data hider and the cover media can be losslessly recovered after the extraction of the embedded data. Although, in recent years, extensive studies have been carried out about images based RDH-ED, little attention is paid to RDH-ED in 3D meshes due to its complex data structure and irregular geometry. In this paper, we propose a separable RDH-ED method for 3D meshes based on integer mapping and Multi-MSB (multiplication most significant bit) prediction. The proposed method divides all the vertices of the mesh into the "embedded" set and "reference" set, and maps decimals of the vertex into integers. Then, we calculate the Multi-MSB prediction errors for the vertices of the "embedded" set and a bit-stream encryption technique will be executed. Finally, additional data is embedded by replacing the Multi-MSB of the encrypted vertex coordinates. According to different permissions, recipient can obtain the original plaintext meshes, additional data or both. Experimental results show that the proposed method has higher embedding capacity and higher quality of the recovered meshes compared to the state-of-art methods.
